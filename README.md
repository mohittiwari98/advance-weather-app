Installation
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/mohittiwari98/advanced-weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd advanced-weather-app
Open index.html in your preferred browser.

No server-side setup is required. This is a client-side application that interacts with weather APIs.

API Key Setup (If Applicable)
If you are using a weather API that requires an API key (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API), follow these steps:

Sign up for an API key at OpenWeatherMap or your preferred weather API provider.

In the JavaScript file (script.js), replace the API_KEY placeholder with your actual API key:


const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Update any relevant URLs in the JavaScript file to ensure they are calling the correct endpoints for your API.

You can easily modify or add features to the app by editing the following files:

index.html: Modify the layout and content structure of the page.
style.css: Change the appearance of the app, including fonts, colors, and layout adjustments.
script.js: Customize the weather data fetching process, integrate new APIs, or adjust the logic for temperature units and geolocation.
